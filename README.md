# Features
- Display a list of servers with player counts, map, gamemode, mod
- If select a server, shows the playerlist, tickets and remaining time
- Launch BF1942 if you doubleclick on a server, with the mod the server is running

## Building
Run build.bat in a x86 VS command prompt. x64 not tested.

## TODO
- Update selected server's playerlist
- Make the GUI look like its atleast 2005, not 1993
