A server browser for Battlefield 1942. My WIN32 GUI hello world project. It uses henk's master server as a data source.

# Features
- Display a list of servers with player counts, map, gamemode, mod
- Show players on servers if you click on them
- Launch BF1942 if you doubleclick on a server, with the mod the server is running

## Building
Run build.bat in a x86 VS command prompt. x64 not tested.

## TODO
- Pings
- Implement GameSpy query over UDP to query servers directly
- Make the GUI look like its atleast 2005, not 1993
